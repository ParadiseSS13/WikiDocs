'''Foreword:''' As the name indicates, Standard Operating Procedure is a set of Guidelines to be followed when the station is functioning nominally. Breaching Standard Operating Procedure without a very good reason is grounds for demotion, at the discretion of the relevant Head of Staff. In addition, blindly following the letter of SOP while ignoring the context of the shift is a '''ridiculously bad idea'''. SOP is malleable if the situation requires it, and the general well-being and proper functioning of the crew and station should not be sacrificed for the sake of rigorous adherence of SOP. Remember, '''context is king'''.

Nanotrasen has a standard set of procedures for crew personnel to follow when there is (or isn't) an emergency. This is to assure that all actions are in the best interests of Nanotrasen. Failure to follow these may result in dismissal/demotion. Extreme or repeated cases may result in a jobban.

'''NOTE:''' Any mentions of "The Station" or "Station" in SOP unless otherwise specified is in reference to the reader's (employee's) assigned Nanotrasen Science Station or Area of Operations. The following (but not limited to) research stations are assigned these SOP documents: NSS Kerberos, NSS Cerebron, NSS Cyberiad, NSS Farragus, and NSS Diagoras.

==Departmental SOP [[File:Folder.png|32px]]==

Along with the guidelines listed below, each and every department has it's own subset of job-specific Standard Operating Procedure that is to be adhered to whenever possible.

 | content    = The following clauses should serve as firm guidelines for financial and money account situations.

==[[File:Id regular.png|32px]] Money Accounts and Space Credits==

* Individual Crew Members have sole ownership over their money account and have discretion over where that money is spent, command or security members may not access crew money accounts unless their account is to be terminated after which the funds should be transferred to a department money account;

* Crew members not working on behalf of a department or not explicitly using a departments resources or facilities are permitted to ask for space credit compensation for personal gain in return for services or products they offer to other crew members;

* Department Money accounts should be used only for purchases for the entire department and not personal orders, departments should prioritize spending their funds on crates that the department needs and only spend money on optional crates when their is a surplus in funds;

* Department heads and command should maintain security over department accounts and only ever give out account credentials to heads of staff or trusted members within the department the respective head of staff oversees, however, heads of staff may at their own discretion enable any member of their department to have approval power over supply crates through the NanoBank PDA app;

* Department account funds are not limited to supply purchases and may be used for other things that would be otherwise beneficial to the station such as reasonable employee bonuses, compensation for non-department crew services, or interdepartmental exchanges.

 | content    = <br>

==[[File:Id regular.png|32px]] Hiring/Transfer Policies==

* No new hires or transfers are permitted without contacting the relevant Head of Staff. If one is not available, promoting an Acting Head of Staff is recommended. If none is available, the Head of Personnel/Captain are to utilize their best judgement (see Command SOP for any exceptions);

* Promotion to Acting Head of Staff requires authorization by the Captain or Acting Captain;

* The following jobs require permission from Central Command before hiring/transfer is done: Blueshield, Nanotrasen Representative, Internal Affairs Agent, and Magistrate. The same applies to any functionally identical job with another title;

* All new hires to the Security Department, and Legal Sub-Department, are to be mindshield implanted and fully checked for unauthorized materials or suspicious communications.

==[[File:Recycler.gif|32px]] Firing/Demotion Policies==

* In the case of a full dismissal, the relevant ID is to be terminated;

* In the case of a demotion, Civilian-level access is recommended. Alternatively, jobs such as Janitor or Clown may also be used;

* No dismissals or demotions are to be performed without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff or Captain. See Chain of Command for how to handle dismissing a member of Command;

* Personnel are to report to the Head of Personnel for dismissal/demotion. Failure to do so will lead to Security detaining them forcefully;

* After a legal dismissal/demotion order is given to the person dismissed/demoted (e.g: by radio), any activity inside the previously assigned Department is to be considered Trespassing/Major Trespassing, and any item kept from said Department is to be considered Petty Theft/Theft. It is, as such, highly recommended that dismissed/demoted personnel willingly turn in all restricted items and cooperate with the process if they wish to avoid being brigged.

===Causes for Demotion and Dismissal===
{{Hatnote|Refer to the above for dismissal authority. Ultimately, the decision to fire/demote any personnel falls to the relevant Head of Staff or Captain. This is merely a list of reasons to fire someone over.}}

* Any medium-severe breach of Standard Operating Procedure without proper cause;

* Any medium crime or higher;

* Critical incompetence at a given job;

* Refusal to follow legal and relevant orders by the respective Head of Staff. Legality and relevance of said orders are to be judged by the Captain or Head of Personnel;

* Creation of an abusive and/or unsafe work environment. Personnel consistently berating, insulting, belittling, or otherwise treating their coworkers like dirt, should be immediately disciplined.

===Vote of No Confidence===
{{Hatnote|A Vote of No Confidence is a method for crew to arrange for demotions of unfit command members. It must have a justified reason, detailed below, against the Head of Staff or Captain in question.}}

* Votes by departamental crew against their Head of Staff must pass with a 2/3 majority in favor of the vote for it to take effect.

* Votes by Heads of Staff against their Captain must pass a simple majority in favor of the vote for it to take effect.

* Justified reasons for a vote include but are not limited to; 'Causes for Demotion and Dismissal' breaches, absenteeism, critical lack of communication, abuse of authority and incompetence, among others.

* Unjustified reasons for a vote include but are not limited to; Personal gripes, reasonable and legal disciplining or firing of their staff and denial of permission, among others. 

* Any of the involved crew members may request a third party to tally the votes, verify the validity of the vote's justification and oversee the demotion or transfer of power.

* In case of a vote by departamental crew against their Head of Staff, the first member of the following list who is available will be the neutral party: A member of Central Command, the Captain, the Nanotrasen Representative, the Magistrate, any uninvolved Head of Staff, any Internal Affairs Agent, any Security Officer, any uninvolved crew member.

* In case of a vote by Heads of Staff against their Captain, the first member of the following list who is available will be the neutral party: A member of Central Command, the Nanotrasen Representative, the Magistrate, any Internal Affairs Agent, any Security Officer, any uninvolved crew member.

* If a Captain has been demoted by a vote or a third party rejected the outcome of a vote, Central Command is to be informed via fax of the vote count and reasons, alongside other relevant information of the demotion.

==[[File:EmergencyResponseTeam.png|32px]] Emergency Response Teams==

===Crew Procedures===

* Emergency Response Teams are only to be called when there is a Code Red-level threat or above;

* Emergency Response Teams are not to be called concurrently with the NTV Charon (Escape Shuttle). Pick one or the other;

* Emergency Response Teams are to be called when there is a major emergency aboard the station that the crew does not have the resources to fight properly. This includes, but is not limited to, any hostile threat present without an active Security force, or massive station damage without an active Engineering force;

* Emergency Response Teams are not to be called without majority approval from Command;

* Emergency Response Teams officially outrank anyone short of a Central Command Officer. Unless their actions are blatantly illegal and against the best interest of Nanotrasen, the station and its crew, their orders are to be followed above anyone else's.

===Emergency Response Team Procedures===

* The Emergency Response Team Leader is to ensure that all members of the Team are present before boarding the Station;

* The Emergency Response Team Leader is to be considered the top authority inside the Emergency Response Team. Unless their orders are blatantly illegal and against the best interest of Nanotrasen, the station and its crew, they are to be followed above anyone else's;

* All members of the Emergency Response Team are to activate their helmet cameras (by clicking the button next to their helmet) and maintain open lines of communication between them;

* The Emergency Response Team is to prioritize whatever it was they were called over. Digressions are not permitted;

* The Emergency Response Team is to ensure that none of its equipment falls in the hands of either the crew or hostile forces

==[[File:Airlock_external.png|32px]] NTV Charon - The Escape Shuttle==

* The NTV Charon is not to be called concurrently with an Emergency Response Team. Pick one or the other;

* In the event of hostile biohazard lifeforms appearing on the station (such as Xenomorphs or Class 7-10 Blob Organisms), Central Command is to be notified before the NTV Charon is called. Failure to do so may lead to the Charon being recalled in order to enforce quarantine. Similarly, Central Command may prohibit calling the Charon in order to handle the biohazard;

* In the event that the NTV Charon is called, all personnel are to wrap up their current task and head to the Escape Lobby within, at most, five minutes before departure;

* Forcing an early departure of the NTV Charon is not permitted unless the structural integrity of the Charon is endangered (such as a nearby Gravitational Singularity, or a Meteor Storm), or the safety of the crew aboard the Charon is threatened (such as nearby hostile Ascendants or Nar-Sie Constructs);

* All currently brigged personnel are to be kept in the Shuttle Brig;

* All personnel in critical medical condition are to be given emergency medical aid.

 | content    = The following situations are so outside the range of conventional station operation, that special procedure was drawn up for them. These are by no means rigid guidelines, but merely server as an indicator on what should be done to preserve the integrity of the station and its crew.

==[[File:FireExtinguisher.png|32px]] Fire/Gas Spills ==

* All personnel are to vacate the affected area;

* Hazard Lock systems are to be left untouched. Deliberately opening Hazard Locks during a Fire/Gas Spill in order to open way to the Hazard is to be considered Sabotage/Grand Sabotage;

* Engineering and Atmospherics personnel are to restore the affected area to working and livable condition.

==[[File:Generic_biosuit.png|32px]] [[Guide to Virology|Viral Outbreak Procedures]]==

{{Hatnote|A Viral Outbreak is defined as a situation where a Viral Pathogen has infected a significant portion of the crew (>10%). In the event of a Viral Outbreak, all infected personnel are to direct themselves to Medbay '''immediately'''. Any personnel experiencing odd symptoms are also recommended to head to Medbay, even if there is no Viral Outbreak.''}}

1. All Medbay personnel are to contribute in fighting the outbreak if there are no other critical patients requiring assistance. Eliminating the Viral Threat becomes '''number one priority''';

2. Personnel are to be informed of known symptoms, and directed to Medbay immediately if they are suffering from them;

3. All infected personnel are to be confined to either an Isolated Room, or Virology;

4. A blood sample is to be taken from an infected person, for study;

5. If any infected personnel attempt to leave containment, Medbay Quarantine is to be '''initiated immediately''', and only lifted when more patients need to be admitted, or the Viral Outbreak is over;

6. The cure must be identified, and administered to at least one (1) infected person. A blood sample must then be taken in order to produce a Vaccine;

7. Once Vaccines are produced, they are to be handed out to all infected personnel;

8. A sample of blood with the correct Antibodies must be kept in storage, in case any stray cases remained untreated;

9. In case the Viral Pathogen leads to fluid leakage, cleaning these fluids is to be considered '''top priority''';

10. Once the Viral Outbreak is over, all personnel are to return to regular duties.

==[[File:Meteor.gif|32px]] Meteor Storms==

* Personnel are to head to the Central Primary Hallway for the duration of the storm;

* No repair activities are to be performed until the end of the storm, for safety reasons;

* All personnel performing EVA duty are to return to the station post haste;

* In the case of a short storm, Engineering is to repair any damage done ASAP;

* In the case of a prolonged storm, no repair activities on non-critical components are to be performed. Personnel are to remain in the Central Primary Hallway, and all efforts focused on maintaining the integrity of the area. The NTV Charon is to be called when possible (at the discretion of Command), and an early launch is permitted.

==[[File:Singulo_1.gif|32px]] Singularity Containment Failure==

The Gravitational Singularity is to be tracked at all costs. If the Gravitational Singularity heads towards the main station, the NTV Charon is to be called. If the Gravitational Singularity heads off-station, damage done to the station should be taken into consideration. See below:

* In the case of massive station damage, the NTV Charon is to be called;

* In the case of light-medium station damage, an ERT is recommended, or, in the case of a competent Engineering team, merely extensive repairs.

==[[File:Tesla gen.png|32px]] Tesla Containment Failure==

* The Tesla Matrix is to be tracked at all costs, and its current location announced to the crew;

* If the Tesla Matrix remains inside the Station rather than arcing into space, the Charon is to be called.

==[[File:Supermatter.png|32px]] Supermatter Delamination Event==

* The Supermatter Crystal is to be vented to space;

* In such a case as the Supermatter Crystal containment was not equipped with a way to space the Crystal, the area around the Crystal is to be evacuated, and all personnel involved in the construction fired and brigged for Sabotage.

==[[File:DarkGygax.png|32px]] Syndicate Declaration of War==

* All weapons restrictions are lifted. Beepsky, and any other Security Bots, should have their protocols updated to reflect this;

* Supply should focus on requesting as many weapons as possible. Security is to be prioritized for distribution, but regular personnel may also be armed;

* Research and Development is to be manned. This is not negotiable. Science should work in tandem with Mining in order to fabricate weapons and equipment to fight the Syndicate Attack Team;

* Erecting barricades in critical locations is highly recommended;

* The NTV Charon may be called at the discretion of Command. If the station is not damaged after the fighting has subsided, it is recommended that the crew finish the shift.

==[[File:Ntflagfire.gif|32px]] Confirmed Revolution==

* All personnel are to comply with orders from Security personnel, so long as said orders are lawful. Failure to do so is grounds for detainment and inspection of possessions, as well as possible Mindshield Implantation, at the discretion of the Head of Security, or Acting Head of Security;

* All personnel that are brigged for Medium Crimes or higher are to receive Mindshield Implantation. Similarly, if the number of active revolutionaries is more than twice the number of loyalists, the Head of Security or Acting Head of Security may order random implantation of crew members;

* Lethal force is fully authorized if the number of active revolutionaries is more than twice the number of loyalists, and said revolutionaries are actively hostile.
