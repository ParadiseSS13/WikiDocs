'''''Foreword:''''' '''Job SOP should not be a considered a checklist of conditions to fire someone over, and should not be rigidly followed to the letter in detriment of circumstances and context. As always, SOP can be malleable if the situation so requires, and the decision to punish a crewmember for breaching it ultimately falls onto the relevant Head of Staff, for Department Members, or Captain, for the Head of Staff.'''

----

1.    The Research Director must make sure Research is being done. Research must be completed by the end of the shift, assuming Science is provided the materials for it by Supply;

2.    The Research Director is permitted to carry a telescopic baton and a flash;

3.    The Research Director is not permitted to bring harmful chemicals outside of Science;

4.    The Research Director is permitted to carry their Reactive Teleport Armour on their person. However, it is highly recommended they keep it inactive unless necessary, for personal safety;

5.    The Research Director is not permitted to authorize the construction of AI Units without the Captain’s approval. An exception is made if the station was not provided with an AI Unit, or a previous AI Unit had to be destroyed. If an AI does exist already, it's permission is required before constructing a new AI, unless it is clearly malfunctioning or subverted.

6.    The Research Director must keep the Communications Decryption Key on their person at all times, or at least somewhere safe and out of reach;

7.    The Research Director is permitted to change the AI Unit’s lawset, provided they receive general approval from the Captain and another Head of Staff. If there are no other Heads of Staff available, Captain approval will suffice;

8.    The Research Director must work with Robotics to make sure all Cyborgs remain slaved to the station’s AI Unit, except in such a situation where the AI Unit has been subverted or is malfunctioning.

2.    In addition to the a telescopic baton and flash, the Research Director is permitted to carry a single weapon created in the Protolathe, provided they receive authorization from the Head of Security. Exception is made during extreme emergencies, such as Nuclear Operatives or Blob Organisms.

3.    The Research Director is permitted to bring harmful chemicals outside of Science for delivery to security personnel, so long as either the Head of Security or Captain authorises it. Said chemicals must be for security-oriented purposes (thermite, controlled explosives, crowd control, biohazard containment, etc.).

If permitted, the Mechs is to be delivered to the Armory for storage. The Research Director is placed under the same restrictions;

2.    The Roboticist is freely permitted to construct Utility Mechs, along with any assorted Utility Equipment. This refers to Ripleys (to be handed to Mining), Firefighting Ripleys (to be handed to Atmospherics), Nkarrdem Janitoral Mechs (to be handed to the Janitor), and the Odysseus Medical Mech (to be handed to Medical). The HONK Mech or Reticence is not to be constructed without '''full approval by the Research Director and Captain''';

3.    The Roboticist is freely permitted to construct Cyborgs and all assorted equipment;

4.    The Roboticist is not permitted to transfer personnel MMIs into Cyborgs without express written consent from the person in question. The consent form should be kept safe;

5.    The Roboticist is to follow RD Green SOP #5 in constructing new AIs as well as requiring the Research Director's approval.

6.    The Roboticist must place a Tracking Beacon on all constructed Mechs;

7.    The Roboticist must work together with the Research Director to make sure all Cyborgs remain slaved to the station’s AI Unit, except in such a situation where the AI Unit has been subverted or is malfunctioning;

8.    The Roboticist must DNA-Lock all parked Mechs prior to delivery. DNA-Lock must be removed when the Mech is delivered to its final destination.

2.    The Roboticist is now permitted to construct Combat Mechs without prior approval. All Combat Mechs must be delivered to the Brig for storage upon completion. Exception is made for extreme emergencies, such as a Blob Organism or Nuclear Operatives, where the Roboticist may pilot the Mech themselves. However, even in these circumstances, the Mech must be delivered to the Armory after the emergency is over. The Research Director is placed under the same restrictions.

1.    Scientists are not permitted to bring grenades outside of Science;

2.    Scientists are not permitted to bring harmful chemicals outside of Science;

3.    Scientists are not permitted to bring Toxins bombs outside of Science. Exception is made if the Toxins Bomb is handed to Mining, as it can be useful for mining operations;

4.    While not mandatory, it is highly recommended that Scientists give a prior warning before a Toxins test. This must be done via the Common Communication Channel, with at least ten (10) seconds between the warning and detonation;

5.    Scientists must, at all times, keep live slimes and Golden Extract-based lifeforms inside Xenobiology pens, except when transporting them to new cells. Peaceful Golden Extract lifeforms may be released with the express permission of the Research Director. In addition, injecting plasma into Golden Extract is strictly forbidden;

6.    Scientists are not permitted to construct the Portable Wormhole Generator without express permission from the Research Director. In addition, Scientists are not to hand out Weapon Lockboxes to any non-Security or non-Command personnel without express permission from the Head of Security;
